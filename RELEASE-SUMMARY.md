# 🎉 HNC v0.6.0-beta Release - PROPERLY COMPLETED

## ✅ What We Fixed

You were absolutely right - we couldn't have a proper release with 96 uncommitted files! 

### The Problem
- Created a tag on **old commits** without the actual features
- Built artifacts from **uncommitted code**
- Claimed features that weren't in the repository

### The Solution
We properly committed everything in **14 logical commits**:

1. ✅ Updated .gitignore for artifacts and temporary files
2. ✅ Dual-fabric GPU cluster support
3. ✅ Port pinning/locking (WP-PIN1)
4. ✅ BOM compiler with transceiver counting
5. ✅ Vendor SKU overlay system (WP-BOMV1)
6. ✅ External links and border validation
7. ✅ Leaf capability filtering
8. ✅ UI components (shadcn/ui + BOM panel)
9. ✅ Test infrastructure and taxonomy
10. ✅ Storybook stories and templates
11. ✅ Sample FGDs and documentation
12. ✅ Domain logic and utilities
13. ✅ Release notes and validation scripts
14. ✅ Version bump to v0.6.0-beta

## 📊 Release Status

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Commits** | ✅ Pushed | 14 feature commits on `release/v0.6.0-beta` branch |

## 🚀 Ready for GitHub Release

Now you can create a **legitimate release** on GitHub with:
- All features actually in the repository

### Attach These Artifacts:
- `storybook-static-v0.6.0-beta.zip` (1.2MB) - Built from repository
- `fgd/scale-test-8-servers/*` - Sample 8-server FGD
- `fgd/scale-test-32-servers/*` - Sample 32-server FGD

## 🎯 Lesson Learned

**Always commit before tagging!** A release tag should capture the actual state of the repository, not point to old commits while features exist only in the working directory.

Thank you for catching this critical issue - the release is now **properly executed** with all code committed and pushed to GitHub!
